echo -e "OK then..."

echo -e "Let's say that you have one of the best VPN in the world and you want to connect to ifitakeyouripyouaredead.com (fake url)"
echo -e "Which browser will you choose to browse it?"
echo -e "Most likely with one that is included in Browsers list,right?"
echo
echo -e "Well...it's not that simple to be hidden from everything with just a VPN and an anonymous browser EXCEPT Tor browser"
echo -e "which theoritically and practically has some vulnerabilities that will be discovered in the future as like the other browsers..."
echo -e "${ORANGE}-${MAINCOLOR} So this is one reason why it's not working all this staff. Cause of browsers' ${RED}vulnerabilities.${MAINCOLOR}"
echo -e "In 2015 FBI did an old attack method in an onion site. They uploaded a malicious in Tor's network and revealed MANY IP addresses and arrested MANY people."
echo
echo -e "${ORANGE}-${MAINCOLOR} Another problem is that browsers like Brave,Tor,Sphere etc. have the code of other official browsers like Chrome and Firefox."
echo -e "Firefox is the only official browser which let's you disable ${RED}WebRTC${MAINCOLOR}."
echo -e "WebRTC is a browser flaw that could not be avoided with the alteration in your networking system or to your VPN."
echo -e "With simple words, it reveales your IP address. You can disable it but if you do it, then you may have problems with some sites that they need WebRTC enabled"
echo -e "and VPN cannot help you with that."
echo -e "And WebRTC is not the only browser flaw that reveales your IP. I cut my hand that Google has put some flaws like WebRTC in Chrome to find out who is who with or without VPN."
echo -e "If you want a VPN to just browse something that is not available in your country, ${RED}then just use FREE proxy${MAINCOLOR}. It's faster and easier than a VPN most of the times."
echo -e "So why you want to use a VPN...?"
echo
echo -e "I hope I changed your mind and saved your money..."
echo -e "If I didn't..."
echo -e "To be more safe,go and pay at least 2 VPN services and use both of them via Tor and tell me when your page will be loaded. NOT EVEN 127.0.0.1 WILL BE LOADED."
echo -e "See you in jail ;)"
